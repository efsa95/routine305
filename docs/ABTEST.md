### A/B Test Name: Progress Message - "X Workouts Toward Goal" vs. "Keep Going! X Workouts Logged"
### User Story Number: US10 Track User Retention
### Metrics:  
- Happiness: User-reported satisfaction with tracking their progress (if feedback is collected).
- Engagement: Number of users who log at least one additional workout after seeing the message.
- Retention: Percentage of users who return to the app within a week of seeing the message.
### Hypothesis: 
If we change the progress message from "You are now X workouts toward your weekly goal" to "Keep Going! X Workouts Logged," then users will be more motivated to continue logging workouts, leading to increased engagement and retention.
