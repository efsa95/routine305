## Observation Statement: With question 11, which asked about other applications users use, many responses mentioned that they use multiple apps to track nutrition and workouts (like strength training vs calorie tracking), which shows that integrating them together in one application could be attractive. One response even mentioned using an AI model to do it all for them.
## Supporting Data: Example responses... 
- I use Boostcamp to track exercise, and Cronometer to track nutrition. My favorite feature is how Boostcamp keeps track of the weight and reps you completed the last time. I also like the built in timer so I can track my rest times.
- Arrow and My Fitness Pal
- No but I use AI to help create personalized meal plans and workouts
## Team Action (if any): For a team action, we can do what we were already planning to do – add both workout tracking/planning, along with calorie tracking. I think for specifics, making nutrition tracking and workout tracking in one place, with a simple UI including a tab bar on the bottom of the screen where you can toggle between workout and nutrition. Making it simple and a one stop shop is super important.
