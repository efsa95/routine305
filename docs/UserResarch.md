# Observation 1: 
## Observation Statement: 
Majority likes the AI integration
## Supporting Data: 
Both questions pertaining AI are positive toward having AI judge their workouts and in general are comfortable with it being integrated. 
for me this is a huge surprise since I find AI very intrusive in our life.  Since the general public (our class) likes it we should continue with those features. 

## Team Action (if any):
As stated previously we will be going forward with our AI integration features including building workout routines and giving general workout advice.  I think the option to disable these features would be a good options.

# Observation 2: Leader Board
## Observation Statement: 
The survey results indicate that the majority of respondents support the idea of a leader board where friends can view each other's progress. This suggests that users value social engagement and friendly competition as a motivational factor in tracking their progress.
## Supporting Data: 
52.2% (12/23 responses) agreed with the leader board idea rating at a 4/5. 21.7% (5/23 responses) agreed with the leader board idea giving it a 5/5 rating. This results in 17/23 people (73.9% of peopele) finding this to be a very postive idea within our app. 
## Team Action (if any):

# Observation 3: AI-Powered Food Tracking
## Observation Statement:  
Users were very supportive of having a food tracker where they can take a picture and have nutrition information, including calories, automatically added into the application. 

## Supporting Data:  
Many participants expressed interest in a food tracking without needing to manually enter nutritional details. The main competitor mentioned was Cronometer, which relies on users manually inputting food labels and searching for matching products. We could have an advantage here because as long as the user has access to their food label, they can get precise and exact information knowing that the information is exactly the product that they consumed and not something similar or falsely inputted based on inpropper user submissions. 

## Team Action (if any):  
We should make sure that the AI food label scanning feature is accurate and easy to use. Additionally, we could think about the possibility of integrating barcode scanning for packaged foods as an additional method for convencience and where nutrition information is not available. We need to test and see how things will turn out based on our first few prototypes before optimizing or expanding further.

# Observation 4:
## Observation Statement: 
With question 11, which asked about other applications users use, many responses mentioned that they use multiple apps to track nutrition and workouts (like strength training vs calorie tracking), which shows that integrating them together in one application could be attractive. One response even mentioned using an AI model to do it all for them.
## Supporting Data: 
Example responses... 
- I use Boostcamp to track exercise, and Cronometer to track nutrition. My favorite feature is how Boostcamp keeps track of the weight and reps you completed the last time. I also like the built in timer so I can track my rest times.
- Arrow and My Fitness Pal
- No but I use AI to help create personalized meal plans and workouts
## Team Action (if any): 
For a team action, we can do what we were already planning to do – add both workout tracking/planning, along with calorie tracking. I think for specifics, making nutrition tracking and workout tracking in one place, with a simple UI including a tab bar on the bottom of the screen where you can toggle between workout and nutrition. Making it simple and a one stop shop is super important.
